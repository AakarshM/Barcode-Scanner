# Barcode-Scanner
Quick barcode scanner with Volley/Nutritionix -- This is a simple and efficient barcode scanner, which quickly scans a UPC barcode and finds the 
calories, and the main macros. It has a health indicator, claiming the food is healthy if the carb:protein:fat >= 3:2:1 and unhealthy otherwise. Uses volley
and the Nutritionix API via REST to retrieve information.
